# Game-Of-Sprouts
Created a rational agent that plays the game by making the best possible decisions against the opponent player using the principles of Game Theory.

About the Game:

Start with a few dots (vertices). The game starts with 2 vertices. Players take turns connecting two vertices with a curve (edge) and placing a new vertex along this edge. 
This is done following two rules: 
-> Each vertex can have at most three edges coming from it 
-> Edges must be drawn so that they do not cross or touch any other vertices than the two they are 
   connecting .
If a player is not able to draw an edge according to the rules, the other player wins. 

Implementation:

1) Started with a initial number of 2 vertices.
2) You can either be Player 1 or Player 2 on random basis.
3) After you make a move , press 'enter' for the computer to make its move .
4) When there is no possible move for either of computer or player , the game ends.
